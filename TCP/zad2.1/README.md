## Task 2.1
The client sends and the server receives portions of data of a fixed, small size (on the order of tens of bytes). They can contain a fixed  or generated text - e.g. "abcde....", "bcdef...", etc. After sending the data, the client should terminate. The server once started works until the process is killed. <br>
Implement the program in two variants: C and Python.
